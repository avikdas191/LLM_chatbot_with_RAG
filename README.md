This project focuses on developing and integrating an advanced chatbot using cutting-edge language models. Leveraging Google's BERT model, particularly the "bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad," the chatbot excels in understanding and generating natural language responses, significantly enhancing its ability to handle complex queries with deep bidirectional representation learning. Despite challenges like model selection, hardware constraints, and resource demands, the integration produced a highly effective conversational agent. The project also implemented the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to improve response accuracy by retrieving relevant passages from a dataset. Additionally, the organization's dataset was vectorized using the Sentence Transformer model "all-mpnet-base-v2," enabling advanced NLP tasks. Flask was utilized for backend functionality, and Ngrok facilitated secure external access. A user-friendly interface was developed with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for seamless interaction. Exploratory data analysis and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib provided key insights. This project showcases significant advancements in creating intelligent, user-focused conversational agents and enhancing data analysis through sophisticated NLP techniques.
